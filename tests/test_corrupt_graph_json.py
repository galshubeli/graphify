"""Corrupt graph.json produces an actionable error, not a raw traceback (#1536/#1537).

With the FalkorDB backend the graph lives in the engine, so most former
json.loads callers no longer touch graph.json at all: `build_merge` reads its
base from the store, and `affected.connect_graph` opens a store connection. Two
paths still parse the file and so still need the guarantee:

  * ``diagnostics._read_json_file``  (``graphify diagnose``)
  * ``serve._import_graph_json_into_store`` — the one-time back-compat import of
    a pre-FalkorDB / ``--no-cluster`` graph.json.

A truncated / invalid file (incomplete write, power loss, manual edit) must
produce a clear, actionable error at each — never a raw traceback.
